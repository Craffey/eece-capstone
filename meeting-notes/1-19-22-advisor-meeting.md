# 1/19/2022 Advisor Meeting

Kaushik, John, Julia, Ben, Fatema, Morgan

## Agenda:

Get things rolling for the semester

## Notes:

Kaushik is going to find the due dates of the deliverables

### Two options:

1. [Using a smartphone to get CSI data using Nextmon CSI](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon_csi) 

2. Run GNUradio on the SDRs, receive IQ samples, store them, access the CSI data, then run them through our classifier
At a simple level, our gesture classifications can be mapped to “voice recordings” that play for Alexa (worst case scenario option)

## Action Items:

### Fatema and Ben:

- get access to datasets and potential code available from one of the papers we looked at and get going on the ML model, so when we have our own data we can hit the ground running. 

- for reference... ACM conferences: MobiHoc, MobiCom, MobiSys, NSDI, SenSys,IEEE INFOCOM
 
- make a table with paper, link, data available, code available, experimental setup

### John and Julia:

- get a hello world type GNU radio setup and work towards getting a test bed setup
  - first with no additional hardware send and receive a signal
  - then with wifi router and receiver
- meet with Kaushik’s student some time this week for an intro

### Morgan and Julia:
 - get a flow ready for gesture mapping
    -  What software will we need in order to do:
        - Text to speech
        -  API calls directly to Alexa
        -  Things more complicated than changing the color of a light bulb
        -  Custom skills?
  
### All:

- get equipment list and ordered
    -  Router
    -  4-5 SDRs
    -  Host machine running GNU radio
    -  Echo dot
    -  Smart RGB Light bulb
- Look over our project proposal + evaluate what we have
    - Clean up the clickup page at least for the next couple weeks’ lookout
