# Advisor Meeting 3-2-22

Kaushik, John, Julia, Ben, Fatema, Morgan

## Notes

- cannot affect 1 antenna without affecting the other, but might be able to subtract noise with initialization phase
- 

## Action Items

- d.roy@northeastern.edu Debashri : the ML big guns
- visualize CSI with fewer number of packets (not all 200 at a time) and see if a pattern emerges that isn't visible looking at a whole capture (amp or phase differences)
- test to see if theres power variations in the IQ from nothing vs a hand, if theres a power difference we can make a spectrogram and run a ML model that can take spectrograms (kaushik's people have already worked on this)
