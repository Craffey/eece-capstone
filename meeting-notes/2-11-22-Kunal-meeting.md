# Software pipeline Meeting 2-11-22

Kunal, John, Julia, Ben, Morgan

## Notes

2 ways to collect dataset

1. use the CSI tool and the wifi card
   - Kunal hasnt tried this
   - once its configured you can capture packets

kunal has scripts to do the transmit and the receive

1. Transmit same wifi frame repeatedly
2. receive frames and save to file (do this in pulses, really hard to work with the USRP live in real-time)
3. get CSI with matlab script, save with folder structure that labels the gestures
