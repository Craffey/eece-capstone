# Advisor Meeting 2-9-22

Kaushik, John, Julia, Ben, Fatema, Morgan

## Notes

- Kunals code is using a subset of the subcarriers, we should ask how he did this
- if packet is detected, our CSI will be valid (theres no particular way that it should look on a plot or anything)

## Action Items

- Get confident that we have a matrix of CSI from kunal's code
- Edit the CNN to be able to take a matrix with the new dimmensions
- control smart device from command line, bluetooth
