# Wave

Wave is a technology that utilizes wireless signals to detect hand gestures and control IoT devices easily without needing to speak to a smart speaker such as an Amazon Echo or Google Home.

The current project intention is to detect changes in channel state information (CSI) in wifi packets while different hand gestures are performed, and determine the gesture using a machine learning algorithm.
